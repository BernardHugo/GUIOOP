This is a java OOP project of creating a simple gacha application game. This has been done by Bernard Hugo and my friends Nicholas Javier and Darren Engelbert.
The classes choice of this simple gacha game application consist of S-class, A-class, B-class, C-class, and D-class. The program of the application will randomly pick one class from the classes list and the user will get one random class as the result.
